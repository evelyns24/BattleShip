# Write a short, attention-grabbing description of your project.
desc: A strategic, deduction-based game that involves two players. The player(s) 
first take turns customizing their board with the ships they are provided with 
then, they will take turns guessing the positioning of their opponents' 
battleships on the grid board provided. The game provides feedback for the 
players as the game is played. Players make moves until they miss. Once every 
grid of a ship has been hit, the ship has been sunk, the ship's border squares 
is revealed, and the respective side loses a warship. In order to win, a player
must sink all of their opponent's ships.
