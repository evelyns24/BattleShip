Pitches:

1. Battleship. This project plays the game battleship against an AI. The player will place 4 or 5 ships on their board, while
the computer will place the ships on their board. The player and computer will take turns dropping bombs on the opposing side's
battlefield. If the bomb hits, then they are allotted an extra turn. The computer will have reasonable AI, with some strategy
as to which squares to bomb.
