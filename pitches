Pitches:

1. Battleship. This project plays the game battleship against an AI. The player will place 4 or 5 ships on their board, while
the computer will place the ships on their board. The player and computer will take turns dropping bombs on the opposing side's
battlefield. If the bomb hits, then they are allotted an extra turn. The computer will have reasonable AI, with some strategy
as to which squares to bomb. 

2. 4-Player Chess. This project plays chess with 4 players. Each player is represented by a different colored set of regular chess pieces.
The rules for the moves of each piece in this game are the same as noraml chess. A variant of this game can be played by forming teams 
of two. Teammates work together to checkmate one member of the opposing team, and they cannot capture their teammate's pieces.
