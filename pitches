Pitches:

1. Battleship. This project plays the game battleship against an AI. The player will place 4 or 5 ships on their board, while
the computer will place the ships on their board. The player and computer will take turns dropping bombs on the opposing side's
battlefield. If the bomb hits, then they are allotted an extra turn. The computer will have reasonable AI, with some strategy
as to which squares to bomb. 

2. 4-Player Chess. This project plays chess with 4 players. Each player is represented by a different colored set of regular chess pieces.
The rules for the moves of each piece in this game are the same as noraml chess. A variant of this game can be played by forming teams 
of two. Teammates work together to checkmate one member of the opposing team, and they cannot capture their teammate's pieces.

3. Reversi. This projects plays Reversi with either two players or against an AI. The game will start off with four peices on the board 
(2 white and 2 black). The players will then take turn placing their pieces on the board so that they can capture as many opponent pieces 
as possible. The game ends when the board is entirely filled and the player with the most pieces wins.
