Teamwork Contract:
We the clumsy sloths agree to the following: 
Goals:
Make a sick final project
Learn something about OCaml

Ground Rules:
Check discord at least once a day, and respond to messages.
Don't be late (up to 5 minutes late is okay)
Meet up 2 times a week: Saturday 4pm and Wednesday 2pm
Check each others code once a week
Finish tasks on time and ask for appropriate support when needed

Team Roles:
Split the work evenly. We're going to discuss the direction we want to take our project
before coding.

Accountability:
Using git pull/pushes to keep track of teammates’ progress, and we will hold biweekly meetings to update the tasks that we have completed and will need to be completed. 
If a team member isn’t contributing their share, the first step would be to communicate our concern and reminders for the deadline, see if there is anything the rest of the team can do to provide feedback. If these measures are not sufficient, we will discuss next steps with our PM.

Making Decisions:
We hope to communicate our ideas and reasonings first to resolve any issues. If need be, we will vote to decide how to move forward with the majority of the team (2) agreeing.

Revisiting this contract:
If we find that something in the contract isn’t working, we will revisit and revise the contract.

Having Fun:
That’s what the random channel is for.
We promise to still love each other even after pulling all-nighters together <3

- Gloria, Alisha, Evelyn
