1. What type of modules
   a. ships
   b. player
   c. GUI module
   d. game (two players)
2. What types should be included for each module?
   Ships:

      b. shape
      c. what parts have been hit
   Player:
      a. List of ships + their locations

      c. Number of my ships sunk
      d. Number of my ships remaining
2. How is the game state initialized?
3. How do we play?

Don't write lines of code yet; write spec and possible functions!!
(**[func x y] does .... Requires ....*)
let func x y = Raise (Failure "Unimplemented func")
